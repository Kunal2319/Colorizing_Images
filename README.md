# Colorizing_Images
One of the most exciting applications of deep learning is colorizing black and white images. This task needed a lot of human input and hardcoding several years ago but now the whole process can be done end-to-end with the power of AI and deep learning.Image-to-Image Translation with Conditional Adversarial Networks paper, poupularly known by the name pix2pix, proposed a general solution to many image-to-image tasks in deep learning which one of those was colorization. In this approach two losses are used: L1 loss, which makes it a regression task, and an adversarial (GAN) loss, which helps to solve the problem in an unsupervised manner (by assigning the outputs a number indicating how "real" they look!).In this project I have  implemented what the authors did in the paper.
I trained my model for 15 epochs as it was time consuming. The output after 15 epochs is attached.The results would be more satisfactory if we train the the model for larger number of epochs (say 100).
