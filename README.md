# Image Colorization using pix2pix

## Overview

This project explores the exciting application of deep learning in colorizing black-and-white images. Traditionally, colorization required significant human input and hard coding. However, with the advancements in AI and deep learning, the entire process can now be done end-to-end. The implementation is based on the "Image-to-Image Translation with Conditional Adversarial Networks" paper, commonly known as pix2pix, which proposed a general solution for various image-to-image tasks, including colorization.

## Implementation Details

The pix2pix approach employs two key losses for effective image colorization:

- **L1 Loss:** This loss function turns the colorization task into a regression problem, ensuring that the predicted colors are close to the ground truth.

- **Adversarial (GAN) Loss:** The adversarial loss helps solve the problem in an unsupervised manner. It assigns a score to the outputs based on how "real" they appear, enhancing the overall realism of the colorized images.

## Training

The model was trained for a total of 15 epochs due to time constraints. For optimal results, it is recommended to train the model for a more extended period, such as 100 epochs. The attached output after 15 epochs provides a glimpse of the colorization capabilities, and the results are expected to be more satisfactory with longer training durations.

## Future Work

- **Extended Training:** Consider training the model for a larger number of epochs, e.g., 100, for potentially more satisfactory results.

- **Fine-tuning:** Experiment with model hyperparameters and architecture to further improve colorization performance.
